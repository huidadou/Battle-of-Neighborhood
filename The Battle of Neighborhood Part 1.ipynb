Recently, she asked me where the best location for her tuition center, providing that after her research, the factors affecting the suitability of a tuition center are:\n\n1) Population, esp. population of teenagers who are 12-18 years old:\n\nThe larger the population of students, the larger the market, as more teenagers would need private tuition services;\n\n2) Public transport networks e.g. metro/MRT/buses, etc:\n\nThe well-developed public transport network enables students who live further sway to come to tuition center conveniently;\n\n3) Number of Schools in the area:\n\nHigher concentration of schools means a large amount of students available.\n\nSince Singapore is generally well-connected, I argued that 2) is not that important as long as the tuition in the vicinity of a transportation node (MRT station/Bus Terminal). So I told her that I would focus factor 1) and 3), and the best location would be in an area where with the highest number of students (both residents and school attendees) per unit area."

There are a total of 55 of these areas, organised into five regions. \n\nPlanning Areas are further subdivided into subzones for statistical purposes.\n\n**_b) The Education System_**\n\nThe Singaporean culture of Kiasuism spurs parents provide additional support for their children, for fear of their child \u201closing out\u201d to others. Therefore, parents invest a lot in their children's education, as a good university degree guarantees a higher-paying job. \n\nBesides formal education (local or international schools), 70% of parents also send their children for tuition and 6 in 10 secondary school students pay for private tuition (Straits Times, 2015). The number of tuition centres in Singapore has steadily grow from a list of 700 MOE-registered tuition agencies in 2012, to 800 in 2013 and 840 in 2014, and the tuition industry was worth 1.1 billion in 2018. \n\nMuch of the demand for tuition comes from those preparing for these exams. Peer pressure and competition between parents and students also serve to intensify the demand for tuition.\n"
